            <p>
              Spayces is a passion project birthed out of the need and
              frustration of making quick and easy reservations at restaurants.
              In Ghana, finding a centralized medium with restaurant menus and
              making table reservations ahead is quite difficult for both locals
              and foreigners alike.
            </p>
            <p>
              By providing, reliable and accurate restaurant information
              (personalized menus, prices, location, contact details etc), and
              giving users the option to pre-order meals ahead of the occasion,
              Spayces is meant to make going out to eat as simple and
              stress-free as simple and stress-free can get.
            </p>
            <p>
              How might we help curious users easily access accurate information
              on restaurants, make reseravtions and pre-order meals seamlessly?

            Originally named Resto, we (a team of 2 designers and a full-stack
            developer) wanted to create a marginally better and scalable
            experience for finding restaurants, personalized menus and booking
            table reservations in the city of Accra and neighbouring cities in
            the country. As with most design processes, the first and most
            important step was to understand our user, their needs and their
            goals, and thus with our sleeves rolled up, we set out into the
            problem space.
          </p>
          <p>
            To be sure we were addressing the right problems, we designed our
            process around the end-to-end user experience, validating every step
            of the way with input from real users.

        <div className=" uk-margin-large uk-padding">
          <h2 className="header-text">Unearthing</h2>
          <p>
            My starting point in the process was talking to users to gain
            insight into what they saw, felt and thought about the problem space
            we were working in. Using a mix of user interviews and quantitative
            feedback in the form of a survey, we identified key issues our users
            had within our problem space. We conducted a survey with 38
            individuals using Miro and face-to-face interview sessions with 5
            individuals.
          </p>
          <p>The Key problems we identified were:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Accessing accurate information on restaurants</li>
            <li>
              Poor user experience making these platforms hard to navigate
            </li>
            <li>Last point of contact is missing after making a reservation</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I grouped our findings under common themes using an affinity diagram
            to help us visually identify recurring themes and patterns. This
            would help us identify actionable insights, bring order and clarity
            to the problem and help narrow our focus in order to take the next
            step.

          The survey armed us with insights and the face- to face user
          interviews gave us further understanding of our users’ needs and
          empathy for their preferences, thoughts and feelings. This helped us
          to define our target persona to give context to the challenge.
